# ðŸ“Š Does Fandango Inflate Movie Ratings?

## Overview
This project explores potential bias in Fandangoâ€™s movie ratings, specifically investigating whether Fandango systematically inflated user ratings compared to other platforms such as IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, and Metacritic. The analysis is inspired by Nate Silverâ€™s FiveThirtyEight article that raised concerns about Fandango's objectivity.

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing Steps
1. The year was used as a separate variable, to allow separate analysis.
2. Only films in both Fandango Ratings and All Site Ratings were filtered out and utilized.
3. Normalization of scores to fit them between a 0-5 rating, as present in Fandango ratings.

## Exploratory Data Analysis Conducted:
1. Different sorts of plots, including scatterplots, KDE plots, clustermaps and histograms were utilized, to view the distributions of different variables, counts of differences, and to analyze relationships between critic ratings and user ratings.
2. Comparisons were made between Fandango ratings, and ratings from IMDB, MetaCritic and Rotten Tomatoes.
3. Scores were normalized to make sure all ratings are on the same scale

## Key Findings
1. Fandango shows a higher rating, for even the worst rated films, showing a rating between 3-4.
2. Even the worst film, Taken 3, according to the dataset, was rated a 4.5 stars, whereas the other sites showed a normalized rating of 1.89 stars only.
3. The other sites, such as RT, MetaCritic, and IMDB show other ratings such as between 1-3 only, for the worst films.
